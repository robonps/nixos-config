# 🛠️ NixOS Config  

This is my personal NixOS configuration, using **Nix Flakes** and **Home Manager** to keep everything declarative and reproducible. The setup aims to be clean, modular, and easy to manage, though it’s always a work in progress.  

## 📂 What's Inside  

- **System Configs** – NixOS modules, packages, and services.  
- **Home Manager** – User configs, dotfiles, and customizations.  
- **Flake Setup** – Keeps everything versioned and structured.  

Nothing too fancy—just a setup that works for me and evolves over time. Feel free to explore or borrow ideas.
